Mahoniaâ€”a character-set conversion library for Go

Mahonia is a character-set conversion library implemented in Go. All data is compiled into the executable; it doesn't need any external data files.

Mahonia is now deprecated. I recommend using the standard package at golang.org/x/text/encoding, possibly along with golang.org/x/net/charset
