## Commons FileUpload
The Commons **FileUpload** package makes it easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.

FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to RFC 1867, "Form-based File Upload in HTML". That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the POST method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", then FileUpload can parse that request, and make the results available in a manner easily used by the caller.
