Note on "bench" - it can also refer to something used as a table, with the similarity being that it is long. Eg. workbench.

"Bench" as a seat seems a more American usage.

"Table" is the basic structure: a flat surface on legs. It's called a "desk" if it is designed or used primarily for work (eg. with drawers etc).
