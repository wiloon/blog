## Parasoft Jtest
>http://www.parasoft.com/jsp/products/jtest.jsp>
Parasoft Jtest is an integrated Development Testing solution for automating a broad range of practices proven to improve development team productivity and software quality. It focuses on practices for validating Java code and applications, and it seamlessly integrates with Parasoft SOAtest to enable end-to-end functional and load testing of today's complex, distributed applications and transactions. Jtest facilitates:

* **Static analysis** — static code analysis, data flow static analysis, and metrics analysis
* **Peer code review** process automation—preparation, notification, and tracking
* **Unit testing** — JUnit and Cactus test creation, execution, optimization, and maintenance
* **Runtime error detection** — race conditions, exceptions, resource & memory leaks, security attack vulnerabilities, and more

This provides teams a practical way to prevent, expose, and correct errors in order to ensure that their Java code works as expected. To promote rapid remediation, each problem detected is prioritized based on configurable severity assignments, automatically assigned to the developer who wrote the related code, and distributed to his or her IDE with direct links to the problematic code and a description of how to fix it.

Parasoft's customers, including 58% of the Fortune 500, rely on Jtest for:

* Preventing defects that impact application security, reliability, and performance
* Complying with internal or regulatory quality initiatives
* Ensuring consistency across large and distributed teams
* Increasing productivity by automating tedious yet critical defect-prevention practices
* Successfully implementing popular development methods like TDD, Agile, and XP
