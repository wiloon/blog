## STAR

STAR is an acronym for Situation, Task, Action, Result

什么是STAR法则？

The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format is a job interview technique used by interviewers to gather all the relevant information about a specific capability that the job requires. This interview format is said to have a higher degree of predictability of future on-the-job performance than the traditional interview.
STAR法则是情境 (situation）、任务 (task）、行动 (action）、结果 (result）四项的缩写。STAR法则是一种常常被面试官使用的工具，用来收集面试者与工作相关的具体信息和能力。STAR法则比起传统的面试手法来说，可以更精确地预测面试者未来的工作表现。

Situation: The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
情境：面试官希望你能描述一个最近遇到的挑战或情况。

Task: What did you have to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.
任务：你必须要完成什么任务？面试者想要知道的是你在上述情境下如何去明确自己的任务。

Action: What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what were the alternatives.
行动：你做了什么？面试官想要了解的是你做了什么？为什么做？有没有替代方案？

Results: What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives. What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?
结果：你行动的结果是什么？从你的行动中，你得到了什么？有没有完成你的目标？你从中获得了什么经验教训？之后有没有用到这些经验？
