## possibly; probably; perhaps; maybe

<http://web.etiantian.com/staticpages/study/question/question_701044.htm>

这几个副词都有"可能"的意思,用法如下:

(1) possible"或许；也许",所指的可能性较小,为加强语气,可与can或could连用；与may连用,表示的可能性更小。例如:

It may possibly be true．也许是真的。

Please call me as soon as you possibly can．请尽快给我打电话。

Could you possibly tell me the answer﹖你能告诉我这个答案吗？

(2)probably"很有可能；十之八九",其语义较强,可能性较大。在否定句中,probably不能紧跟在否定词之后。例如:

It will probably be fine tomorrow．明天大概会是晴天。

译: 她大概不会来这里。

正: Probably she won't come here．

正: She probably won't come here．

正: She won't come here probably．

误: She won't probably come here．

(3) perhaps"或许",含有"可能这样,也可能不这样"之意,其含义和用法与maybe一样,多用于口语。maybe多用于美国英语。在这几个单词中,语义最强的是probably,其次是perhaps和maybe,最弱的是possibly。例如:

Perhaps we will be late for work．或许我们上班会迟到。

Perhaps we'd better take a bus．也许我们最好乘公共汽车。
