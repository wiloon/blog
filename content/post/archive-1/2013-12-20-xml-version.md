There are two current versions of XML. The first (_XML 1.0_) was initially defined in 1998. It has undergone minor revisions since then, without being given a new version number, and is currently in its fifth edition, as published on November 26, 2008. It is widely implemented and still recommended for general use.

The second (_XML 1.1_) was initially published on February 4, 2004, the same day as XML 1.0 Third Edition,<sup id="cite_ref-33">[31]</sup> and is currently in its second edition, as published on August 16, 2006. It contains features (some contentious) that are intended to make XML easier to use in certain cases.<sup id="cite_ref-xml11rationale_34-0">[32]</sup> The main changes are to enable the use of line-ending characters used on EBCDIC platforms, and the use of scripts and characters absent from Unicode 3.2. XML 1.1 is not very widely implemented and is recommended for use only by those who need its unique features.<sup id="cite_ref-35">[33]</sup>
