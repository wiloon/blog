Researchers at the University of Kansas say that people can accurately judge 90 percent of a stranger&#8217;s personality simply by looking at the person&#8217;s shoes.

堪萨斯大学的研究人员称，只需看看一个人穿的鞋，就能准确地判断陌生人的90%的性格。

&#8220;Shoes convey a thin but useful slice of information about their wearers,&#8221; the authors wrote in the new study published in the Journal of Research in Personality. &#8220;Shoes serve a practical purpose, and also serve as nonverbal cues with symbolic messages. People tend to pay attention to the shoes they and others wear.&#8221;

这项新研究发表在《个性研究杂志》上，作者写道：“鞋子可传达其主人的细微但有用的信息。鞋子有其实际用途，但也作为非言语信号传递着象征性信息。人们一般都会注意自己和他人穿的鞋。”

Medical Daily notes that the number of detailed personality traits detected in the study include a person&#8217;s general age, their gender, income, political affiliation, and other personality traits, including someone&#8217;s emotional stability.

《医学日报》指出，研究发现鞋子可透露的个性特征细节包括一个人的大概年龄、这个人的性别、收入、政治立场，还有包括情绪稳定性在内的其他个性特征。

Lead researcher Omri Gillath said the judgments were based on the style, cost, color and condition of someone&#8217;s shoes. In the study, 63 University of Kansas students looked at pictures showing 208 different pairs of shoes worn by the study&#8217;s participants. Volunteers in the study were photographed in their most commonly worn shoes, and then filled out a personality questionnaire.

首席研究员欧姆瑞·吉拉斯说，这些判断是基于所穿的鞋的样式、价格、颜色和新旧程度做出的。在研究过程中，63名堪萨斯大学的学生观看了研究参与者穿的208双不同的鞋的图片。参加该研究的志愿者都是穿着自己平日里最常穿的鞋拍的照，然后他们填写了一份性格调查问卷。

So, what do your shoes say about your personality?

那么，你的鞋反映了你的什么性格特点呢?

Some of the results were expected: People with higher incomes most commonly wore expensive shoes, and flashier footwear was typically worn by extroverts.

部分研究结果是在意料之中的：收入高的人大多穿价格昂贵的鞋子，而颜色鲜亮的鞋子通常是性格外向的人穿的。

However, some of the more specific results are intriguing. For example, &#8220;practical and functional&#8221; shoes were generally worn by more &#8220;agreeable&#8221; people, while ankle boots were more closely aligned with &#8220;aggressive&#8221; personalities.

不过，一些更具体的研究结果则十分有趣。例如，“实用、功能性的”鞋子通常是性格“随和”的人穿的，而短靴的主人则大多是性格“强势”的人。

The strangest of all may be that those who wore &#8220;uncomfortable looking&#8221; shoes tend to have &#8220;calm&#8221; personalities.

最奇怪的也许是那些爱穿“看起来不舒服的”鞋子的人竟然性格一般比较“沉着冷静”。

And if you have several pairs of new shoes or take exceptional care of them, you may suffer from &#8220;attachment anxiety,&#8221; spending an inordinate amount of time worrying about what other people think of your appearance.

此外，如果你有好几双新鞋子或者格外爱惜保养这些新鞋，那么你可能患上了“依恋焦虑症”，因为你花了过多的时间来担心其他人对你外表的看法。

There was even a political calculation in the mix with more liberal types wearing &#8220;shabbier and less expensive&#8221; shoes.

研究甚至还发现了鞋子和政治立场之间的关系，那些穿“比较破旧和廉价”的鞋子的人更可能是自由党派。

The researchers noted that some people will choose shoe styles to mask their actual personality traits, but researchers noted that volunteers were also likely to be unaware that their footwear choices were revealing deep insights into their personalities.

研究人员指出，有些人会通过选择鞋子的样式来掩饰他们真实的性格特征，不过研究人员也指出，志愿者们一般都不会意识到自己对鞋的选择会让人窥见性格深处。
