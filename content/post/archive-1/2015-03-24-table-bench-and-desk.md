~A table is an article of furniture supported by one or more vertical legs and having a flat horizontal surface.

~A bench is a long seat, differing from a stool in its greater length.

~A desk is a table, frame, or case, usually with sloping top, but often with flat top, for the use writers and readers. It often has a drawer or repository underneath.

Note on &#8220;bench&#8221; &#8211; it can also refer to something used as a table, with the similarity being that it is long. Eg. workbench.

&#8220;Bench&#8221; as a seat seems a more American usage.

&#8220;Table&#8221; is the basic structure: a flat surface on legs. It&#8217;s called a &#8220;desk&#8221; if it is designed or used primarily for work (eg. with drawers etc).
