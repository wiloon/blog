"I and someone are interested&#8221; is grammatically correct. It is the convention in English that when you list several people including yourself, you put yourself last, so you really should say "Someone and I are interested.&#8221; "Someone and I&#8221; is the subject of the sentence, so you should use the subjective case "I&#8221; rather than the objective "me&#8221;. "Someone and I&#8221; clearly means two people, so you should use "are&#8221; and not "is&#8221;. If it was "Someone or I &#8230;&#8221; then you would use "is&#8221;, because only one person is interested, either "someone&#8221; or "I&#8221;.

It is not uncommon to hear people say "Me and someone are &#8230;&#8221;, but this is wrong because it&#8217;s the wrong case. When an educated person hears "Me and Billy is going to the ball game&#8221;, he immediately thinks this is either a child or a very uneducated person speaking.

"I and someone we &#8230;&#8221; is incorrect because it is redundant. "We&#8221; is simply another way of saying "I and someone&#8221;. It adds no new information to the sentence, and so there is no reason to include it. You can&#8217;t just string together alternative ways of expressing the same idea: If you really need it for clarity or emphasis, you have to surround it with some additional words, like a "that is&#8221;, or sometimes just punctuation that show its purpose in the sentence. You could say, "We, that is, Bob and I, are interested &#8230;&#8221;

All that said, "I and someone&#8221; or "Someone and I&#8221; sounds strange to me, and I suspect most English speakers, because it is an unusual use of the word "someone&#8221;. When "someone&#8221; is used in a list with identifiers of other people, we usually say "someone else&#8221;. Like, "Bob and someone else are interested &#8230;&#8221; rather than "Bob and someone are interested &#8230;&#8221; (I have no idea why this is so; it&#8217;s just the convention.) "Someone&#8221; without "else&#8221; is normally only used when it&#8217;s the only person: "Someone is interesteed &#8230;&#8221;
