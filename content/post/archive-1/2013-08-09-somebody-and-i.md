&#8220;I and someone are interested&#8221; is grammatically correct. It is the convention in English that when you list several people including yourself, you put yourself last, so you really should say &#8220;Someone and I are interested.&#8221; &#8220;Someone and I&#8221; is the subject of the sentence, so you should use the subjective case &#8220;I&#8221; rather than the objective &#8220;me&#8221;. &#8220;Someone and I&#8221; clearly means two people, so you should use &#8220;are&#8221; and not &#8220;is&#8221;. If it was &#8220;Someone or I &#8230;&#8221; then you would use &#8220;is&#8221;, because only one person is interested, either &#8220;someone&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8221;.

It is not uncommon to hear people say &#8220;Me and someone are &#8230;&#8221;, but this is wrong because it&#8217;s the wrong case. When an educated person hears &#8220;Me and Billy is going to the ball game&#8221;, he immediately thinks this is either a child or a very uneducated person speaking.

&#8220;I and someone we &#8230;&#8221; is incorrect because it is redundant. &#8220;We&#8221; is simply another way of saying &#8220;I and someone&#8221;. It adds no new information to the sentence, and so there is no reason to include it. You can&#8217;t just string together alternative ways of expressing the same idea: If you really need it for clarity or emphasis, you have to surround it with some additional words, like a &#8220;that is&#8221;, or sometimes just punctuation that show its purpose in the sentence. You could say, &#8220;We, that is, Bob and I, are interested &#8230;&#8221;

All that said, &#8220;I and someone&#8221; or &#8220;Someone and I&#8221; sounds strange to me, and I suspect most English speakers, because it is an unusual use of the word &#8220;someone&#8221;. When &#8220;someone&#8221; is used in a list with identifiers of other people, we usually say &#8220;someone else&#8221;. Like, &#8220;Bob and someone else are interested &#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;Bob and someone are interested &#8230;&#8221; (I have no idea why this is so; it&#8217;s just the convention.) &#8220;Someone&#8221; without &#8220;else&#8221; is normally only used when it&#8217;s the only person: &#8220;Someone is interesteed &#8230;&#8221;
