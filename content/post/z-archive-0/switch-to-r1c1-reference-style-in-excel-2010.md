## Switch to R1C1 Reference Style in Excel 2010
**Question:**  How do I switch from A1 to R1C1 reference style?  I used to do it in the Options menu, General tab in Excel 2003.  But how do I do it in Excel 2010?

**Answer:
  
** In Excel 2010, you would go to Formula section of the Excel Options dialog box.   Go to File->Options, click on "Formula" on the left side.  On the right side, under "Working with Formulas" section, you will find the checkbox for switching to R1C1 reference style.
