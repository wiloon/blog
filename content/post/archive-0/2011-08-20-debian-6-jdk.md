1. Download binaries from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html, file naem jdk-7-linux-i586.tar.gz

2. extract file

3. Move the newly unpacked jdk1.7.0 folder to the /opt/java/ folder – creating /opt/java folder firstly.

To install JDK 7 you just type:

```bash

sudo update-alternatives -install /usr/bin/java java /opt/java/jdk1.7.0_02/jre/bin/java 2

```

where 2 is the next unused index from the previous command.

If you have more than one JDK's installed, type:

```bash
  
sudo update-alternatives -config java
  
```

This will get you a list of the installed JDK's and their indexes.

This should be repeated for javac and javadoc if you are going to use them via the command line.

```bash
  
sudo update-alternatives -install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/java/jdk1.7.0_02/bin/javac 2
  
```

Finally check that the proper Java is installed by typing:

```bash
  
java -version

javac -version
  
```

edit profile

```bash
   
emacs /etc/profile
  
```

add lines

```bash
   
JAVA_HOME=/opt/jvm/jdk1.7.0
   
export JAVA_HOME
   
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   
export PATH
   
CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA\_HOME/lib/dt.jar:$JAVA\_HOME/lib/tools.jar
   
export CLASSPATH
  
```
