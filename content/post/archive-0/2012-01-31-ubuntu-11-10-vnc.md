Install vnc4server
  
sudo apt-get install vnc4server
  
Install gdm and gnome-panel (This installs the gnome-classic.sessions session file in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/):
  
sudo apt-get install gdm
  
- When asked to choose the default session manager, choose lightdm
  
sudo apt-get install gnome-panel
  
When you launch vnc4server for the first time, you will be asked to set a password and a /home/<user>/.vnc/xstartup will be created for you.
  
- vnc4server Example command: vnc4server -geometry 1024&#215;768 :1 (creates a VNC instance of size 1024&#215;768 an display 1) You can then use a VNC viewer on the client side to connect (I use RealVNC viewer with "<server-name>:<display-number> to connect).
  
We need to change the contents of the /home/<user-name>/.vnc/xstartup file to get things working properly.
  
Contents should look like this:
  
#!/bin/sh
  
\# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
  
unset SESSION_MANAGER
  
unset DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS_ADDRESS
  
#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
  
#. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
  
gnome-session &#8211;session=gnome-classic &
  
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
  
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
  
xsetroot -solid grey
  
vncconfig -iconic &
  
#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80&#215;24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop&#8221; &
  
#x-window-manager &

unset SESSION_MANAGER : Gets rid of any errors like “Could not acquire name on session bus “
  
/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions will have a bunch of .session files. You may use any of these in your xstartup file. For example:
  
gnome-session –session=gnome-classic & gives your classic gnome
  
gnome-session –session=ubuntu-2d & gives you Unity
  
gnome-session –session=ubuntu & does not work!
  
gnome-session & will not work because the default session is “ubuntu”
