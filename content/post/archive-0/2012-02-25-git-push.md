# git push
wiloon@debian:~/development/source/et$ git push
  
No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing.
  
Perhaps you should specify a branch such as 'master'.
  
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
  
error: failed to push some refs to 'gitolite@localhost:et'


should use....Â git push origin master
