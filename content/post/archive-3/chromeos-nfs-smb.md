## chromeos nfs, SMB

Since Chrome 71, SMB is now natively supported by Chrome OS and this Chrome extension/app is deprecated. The new implementation is an order magnitude or two faster and much more reliable.

On Chrome 71 or higher you can:

Open the files app
  
Click the "three dot menu" in the top right
  
Choose "Add New Service"
  
Choose "SMB file share"
